Feel free to upgrade, fix or touch this project by submitting a pull request and I will 
make sure to approve and merge it.

Please note that I am working on this project during my free time, and as just a teenager doing everything
alone, I cannot do it all instantly or at will. If your favourite feature is not found in dnEditor and
you really wish it was there - submit a ticket, and wait. I will eventually get through it.

##### Cheers!

## Credits and thanks:
 - 0xd4d (dnlib) for the epic library that made this whole project possible and the time he took to help me. 
 Yes, if dnlib didn't exist, this would have only been a fancy dream.
 - WiCKY Hu (Simple Assembly Explorer) for his amazing piece of work. I "borrowed" many ideas and features
 from there, for which I hope I won't have done any bad.
 - yck1509 (dnSpy & dnlib fork) for the first dnlib-based assembly decompiler. That definitely served me as a
 reference of dnlib itself and what I wasn't sure how to do. I am also using "a fork of his fork of dnlib",
 though I use none of his implementations. Still worth mentioning.
 - Sebastien LEBRETON (Reflexil) for the currently only fully-working and fully-featured assembly
 editor. If you find something similar in dnEditor's design: it's either Reflexil that inspired me
 or Reflexil that made me use the (almost) same design.
 - The guys behind ICSHARPCODE (ILSpy) [Daniel Grunwald, David Srbecky, Ed Harvey, Siegfried Pammer
 Artur Zgodzinski, Eusebiu Marcu, Pent Ploompuu] for their unbelievable work. 
 If they didn't keep their everything open-source I wouldn't have been able to add the decompiler for some 15 minutes.
 - li0nsar3c00l for wanting to be here. And for helping me out too, of course.
 - XenoCode for the icon dnEditor currently uses.
